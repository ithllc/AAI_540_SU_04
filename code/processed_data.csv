Fruit flies are pesky warm weather pests who invade your kitchen using ripening fruit as their breeding ground. The flies have a lifespan of 8-10 days but are able to lay as many as 500 eggs at a time when they reach maturity. Ripening fruit is not the only place they reproduce. They also grow in moisture-inhabited places like drains, sponges, garbage disposals, and empty bottles.

Along with fruit flies, drain flies and common house flies can be frustrating and annoying pests. There are ways, however, to stop these insects dead in their tracks.

Though they can be a frustrating sight to encounter, aphids are relatively easy to keep in check, provided that you're persistent and use safe removal practices. These soft bodied insects use their piercing mouthparts to suck sap from the leaves of plants.
Remove small clusters of aphids by hand, and try selective pruning or homemade organic repellent sprays for a more lasting effect. Once they're gone, introduce beneficial new plant and insect species to your garden to discourage any pests that might be waiting in the wings from returning with a vengeance.

Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the key nutrients that plants need to grow. Whether it's been washed away by water or used up for flowering and fruiting, low potassium requires a soil adjustment. Fortunately, lots of organic solutions are available for both quick fixes and long-term soil maintenance.

In addition, testing your soil every one to two years will let you know exactly what amendments to make.

A check valve is an important part of keeping a sump pump system running. Sump pumps drain water out of damp areas, such as the basement of your home. The valve prevents water from running back down to the sump pump. To install a pump valve, you either have to detach the old valve or cut through the drainage pipe to fit a new one. The installation process isn’t complicated, though cutting and cementing all the PVC parts together can be precise work. However, once you fit the valve perfectly, your sump pump will deactivate when it doesn’t detect water, preventing it from burning out.

Air plants, known as Tillandsia (Tillandsia spp.), cannot live on air alone. They are epiphytes that grow naturally in cracks in rocks and on trees and they do not need soil. They grow best in USDA Hardiness Zones 8 to 11, so they can survive temperatures that dip to 10 degrees F (-9.4 degrees C). They require a bright, sunny location but that requirement is easily met, even in a house that does not have a sunny window.

The Salmon Ladder is a grueling climbing obstacle. To overcome it, you must ascend to the top of a pair of vertical posts by hopping a free-moving bar up one rung at a time. The structure is designed to push your explosive power, upper body strength, hand-eye coordination, and endurance to the limit. Luckily, constructing a homemade version of the obstacle isn’t as challenging as actually completing it. In fact, it’s as simple as attaching a few angled rungs to two sturdy support posts and setting them into the ground. With a Salmon Ladder in your own backyard, you’ll be able to elevate your training regimen to the next level.
